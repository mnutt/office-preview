# Office Preview

This small Sandstorm app can preview an office document (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) in-browser. It uses LibreOffice to do the conversion to HTML. The conversion is best-effort and often doesn't do a great job of preserving styling.

While you can launch this app and preview a file, it is mostly intended to be used by Davros and others via the Powerbox API.
